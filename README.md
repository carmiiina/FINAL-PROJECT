General
 Develop a website that consists of at least five pages: a home page, a contact page, and three content
pages.

You decide what subject you’re going to use for your website. It can be about you, a
relative, a friend, a pet, a course, a hobby, a product, an issue…you decide.

Be sure that you know enough about the subject of your website so it will be easy for
you to create the content for your pages. If possible, you should also have three or
more related image files that you can use in your web pages.

4 Parts of the Semester Project

Part 1: Define the goals, the audience, page topics, and a call to action

Part 2: Develop the site map

Part 3: Wireframe the critical pages

Part 4: Develop the actual pages

See the project document for further details.

For Part 4, please submit the following:

1) A link to your site on Github pages.

2) A link to the Git repository containing all code for your site. The Git repository must be registered to you.

Each project must be at least 5-6 pages and have the following:

    You must use Bootstrap.
    You must use Cards as part of your design.
    Your home page template must be different than the interior pages.
    You must have one interior page below another in the navigation menu in order to show 2-tier navigation.
    You must have a contact form. The contact form does not have to submit to a database, but must have all of the elements such text fields and a submit button.
    You design must be responsive so that when the project is viewed on a smaller width device, the fonts and images scale. Sections, Asides, Divisions must all float.
    Responsive navigation must be implemented when the menu is viewed in a smaller viewport. Bootstrap provides this automatically.
    Again, you must use Bootstrap for your development.

You must have comment in each file with your name and course number.

Example:

In the HTML files:

<!-- DEVELOPER: your name here, IS117-xxx, Spring 2021 ->

In the CSS files that you develop:

/*DEVELOPER: your name here, IS117-xxx, Semester, Year */

For example:

/* DEVELOPER Art Hendela, IS117-004, Spring 2021 */
